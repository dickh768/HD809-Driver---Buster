- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dickh768

- I've created this account initially to share my attempt at creating a Linux driver for the HD809 / Sin Hon TDH603  TV Stick

- These USB TV sticks are designed to provide FTA reception of DVB-T signals on Android tablets with both SD and HD channels. I bought one hoping it could replace one of my SD-only sticks which I have been using for several years. I subsequently found that there was no fully working linux driver so I have been spending a few weeks of lockdown learning how a driver works and refreshing my very basic C skills. 

I have now hacked together a system which works well on a Raspberry Pi. Others may find my experiences useful in pursuing similar projects.

Details are in the file Investigation.epub  - those without an epub reader can unzip the file and read the .xhtml files in a browser.
